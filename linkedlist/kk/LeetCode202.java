Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
        12 + 92 = 82
        82 + 22 = 68
        62 + 82 = 100
        12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false

    // This approach uses Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (slow & fast pointers) to detect cycles efficiently.
    // The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps (applying getSquareSum twice).
    // If they meet, a cycle exists, meaning the number is not happy unless slow == 1 after the loop.
    // We check slow == 1 at the end instead of fast == 1 because fast might skip 1 due to its double-step movement.
